    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>The habit of reading books was cultivated when I was a kid. I used to read lots of small story books then. But as I grew, my choice also grew and now I like reading more of books and articles that gives me more information and knowledge. Reading is not only a wonderful hobby, but one that enables us to acquire so much knowledge, much beyond what we could ever imagine of. A person who reads would be aware almost of all facts and happenings around them. They would be in knowledge with lots of facts and figures that would help them in the long run.Though all hobbies have their own merits and demerits in their own ways, reading is one which has more of merits than demerits. I would personally recommend that all of us should cultivate the habit of reading as there is no other better source of keeping one aware and out of being fooled when you have the knowledge of the fact what you need to know. Reading is a great hobby that I am proud to be possessing and I am just in love with it.</p>
